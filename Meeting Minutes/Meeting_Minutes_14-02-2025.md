## 🛠️ **Progress Updates & Next Tasks:**  

| **Team Member** | **What Was Completed?** | **Next Steps** |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Steven** | Created `supabaseAPI` to centralize all Supabase calls for better scalability & cleanliness. | Write unit tests for the API methods and refactor existing code to integrate the new API. |
| **Mai** | Fixed a bug in the register screen where unintended front-end elements were being displayed. | Implement real-time message updates and improve the UI for messaging. |
| **Shayaan** | Implemented an improved logout function and started UI development for sending & displaying channel messages. | Complete the UI for channel messaging and implement real-time text channels for group communication. |
| **Mohamed** | Resolved an issue with the authentication system in the login page. | Start building a **group messaging service** that allows users to communicate in group chats and channels. |
| **Hala** | Managed documentation (meeting minutes, sprint planning), reorganized the GitHub project, and started working on real-time messaging. | Work on **CI/CD pipeline integration**, continue implementing real-time messaging, and maintain further documentation. |
| **Haytham (Scrum Leader)** | Fixed front-end and back-end registering functionality. Started preparing Supabase policies for message sending and related data handling. | Update the front-end to correctly match database information of channels and messages, enabling full messaging feature testing. |

## ✅ **Key Decisions:**  
- Focus on **real-time messaging implementation** for both **group and direct communication**.  
- **Supabase API integration** will help streamline database calls and improve maintainability.  
- **Unit testing for API methods** will be done before full implementation.  
- **UI improvements** will ensure better usability and responsiveness for messaging.  

## 📌 **Next Steps:**  
- Continue development based on individual task assignments.  
- Conduct testing on **authentication, messaging, and Supabase API integration**.  
- Regular code reviews to ensure scalability and maintainability.
